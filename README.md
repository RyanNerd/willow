~ [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Willow)

For developers, Willow is an _opinionated_ PHP framework used to quickly create CRUD based RESTful APIs.

💒Willow is a marriage between [Slim](http://slimframework.com) and [Eloquent ORM](https://github.com/illuminate/database)
with [Robo](http://robo.li/) as your [wedding planner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_planner).

For instructions and getting started see the [Willow Framework User Guide](https://www.notion.so/Willow-Framework-Users-Guide-bf56317580884ccd95ed8d3889f83c72)

Go [here](https://github.com/RyanNerd/willow/tree/1.x) for the previous version of Willow (1.1)

Willow works best as a framework in this situation:
* You need to quickly spin up a [RESTful](https://restfulapi.net/) [datacentric](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-crud) API
* You have defined your database with entities (tables/views) already in place
* You are just starting your project (for the backend API handler) and need to _hit the ground running_

### 📃 Requirements
* PHP 7.4+ (Willow 3.0+)
* ~~PHP 7.4+ (Willow 2.0+)~~ _No longer supported_
* ~~PHP 7.2+ (Willow 1.1+)~~ _No longer supported_
* Databases:
    - MySQL 5.6+
    - SQLite3
    - Postgres (untested)
    - MSSQL (untested)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) (For Willow to work best this must be installed globally)

### 💾 Installation
To install Willow run:

```bash
composer create-project --ignore-platform-reqs ryannerd/willow:^3 [your-project-name]
cd [your-project-name]
```

This will create a skeleton Willow project. Willow tries to symlink to [robo](https://robo.li/) You can then use Willow (robo) commands to build your app.

### Sample

```
// Linux / Mac users do this:
./willow sample

// Windows users execute this:
php -S localhost:8088 -t public
// Then in your favorite web browser go to: localhost:8088/v1/sample/hello-world
```

The result in your browser should look something like this:

```json
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "success": true,
  "status": 200,
  "data": {
    "id": "hello-world"
  },
  "missing": [ ],
  "message": "Sample test",
  "timestamp": 1556903905
}
```

###  Willow (robo) Commands

```bash
# Documentation and demo
./willow docs   # bring up the documentation web page
./willow list   # list all available Willow commands
./willow sample # launch the sample API in a web browser
./willow banner # show the Willow introductory banner

# Willow core commands
./willow make   # Connects to your database and builds routes, controllers, models, actions, etc.
./willow reset  # Resets the project back to factory defaults
./willow eject  # Removes the sample artifacts from the project

# Database commands
./willow tables  # list all the tables in the database
./willow details # Show details (column names and types) of a selected table
```
