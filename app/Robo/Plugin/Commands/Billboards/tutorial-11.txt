     *     *    *  *    *     Consider this code in the ClientController
 * *   *    *    *    *   *   <bold><blue>$grp->get('client/{id}', ClientGetAction::class);</bold></blue>
 *     *  *    * * .#  *   *  When the GET route "client/id" is requested the
 *   *     * #.  .# *   *     __invoke() method in the ClientGetAction class is
  *     "#.  #: #" * *    *   executed.
 *   * * "#. ##"       *
   *       "###               __invoke() receives three arguments:
             "##              <bold><blue>Request $request, Response $response, array $args</bold></blue>
              ##.             $request is a Slim Request object, $response is
              .##:            also a Slim object, and $args are the request
              :###            arguments {id} in this example. So if the route
              ;###            is "client/435" $args would be the array ["435"]
            ,####.
